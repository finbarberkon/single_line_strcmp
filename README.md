# single line strcmp
When I was a tutor at UNSW CSE, a student challenged me to write a solution for strcmp that is [POSIX compliant](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strcmp.3.html) and only one line of C code. No funny business like just joining two statements into one line unless it is part of a C feature like a for loop.

This was a fun puzzle. The solution is in `mystrcmp.c`, but I hope you have a go yourself first.

Please let me know if you find any bugs in my implementation, or have a solution for the issue I describe in the `mystrcmp.c`.
